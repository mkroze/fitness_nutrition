This is an app made for the everyday man it should enable the user to find proper guidance in his/her diet. 
 So far i was able to make a soothing front end witht he right color palette.
 As well as handle the request to edemam API, on top of that i made a calculator of the required nutrients according to the user data, and based on this result it fetches the API for the right menu suggestions that will help the user achieve these goals.

 What is left before launching the app is to handle the membership space and the login form. this will be done most likely on the next commit.

 first attempt using firebase, whatever the hell that might be.
 I used clerk which was way easier than firebase, and i got everything up and running in a matter of minutes.
 Now i need to clean out the useless chunks of firebase code and think about a mongodb model to store data about users .
